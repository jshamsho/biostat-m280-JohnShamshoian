I took this course in Spring of 2017 by Dr. Hua Zhou at UCLA. This was a PhD level course designed to teach computational methods in biostatistics, such as QR factorization, SVD, EM and MM algorithms, and constrained optimization. The course consisted of 5 online homeworks and several in class quizzes. I received an A+ in this course.
